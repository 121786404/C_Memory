DESIGN:
  Leakcount   - Leakcount is relatively simple. It parses the terminal commands,
	        and uses them to call execvpe in the child process. The parent
	        simply waits for the child to finish and then exits.

  Memory_Shim - Utilized by the child process created in leakcount. Serves to 
		intercept calls to malloc/free. It uses a linked list to store
		the ptrs created by malloc and the size of memory created. In 
		the destructor I first iterate all the way through the list, and
		store any unfreed mem in leaks[]. I then use leaks[] to print
		afterwards. This is because, when I try to print during my iteration
		through the list, fprintf was calling malloc and modifing the list
		as I was trying to go through it.

EXECUTION:
	        ./leakcount ./test_prog
		./leakcount ./test_prog test_prog_arg
